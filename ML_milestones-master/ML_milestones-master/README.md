# Machine Learning - Milestones

Hi everyone !

You code with Python & You are new to Machine Learning ? YOU ARE WELCOME TO THE GOLDEN PALACE !!!

This repository contains python implementations of basic as well as advanced Machine Learning projects every machine learning programmer should be familiar with.

The main goal of sharing these pieces of code here is to bring you with the milestones of every ML project and to provide a cheat sheet of several classical ML problems so that you can rapidly recall basic knowledge and ideas when working on new projects.

Please feel free to make any contribution to make it better.

## Content

- *The housing project* : 

Build a model (from scratch) of housing prices in California using the California census data. The model is implementd with sklearn to learn from data and to be able to predict the median housing price given all the other metrics. 


- *A step-by-step guide to build a deep neural network* :

Expose all the required functions to build a Deep Neural Network. The 5-layer deepNN implementation is then used for an image classification case study. [numpy and sklearn]


- *Build and apply a deep neural network to supervised learning : image classification with the two moons dataset* :

The aim of this project is to provide you Ith a full understanding of how NNs are built, their building blocs and how they process data; in other words, you will understand how ML's NNs algorithms think. In this implementation I used several optimizers : gradient descent (gd) optimizer, gd with momentum optimizer and with Adam optimizer. As a dataset, I use the two moons 2D one, imported from the sklearn's datasets


- *TensorFlow -Digits dataset-* : 

Until now, we've always used numpy to build NNs. In this project, a DL framework is used to allow us build NNs more easily: TensorFlow
I used a sub set of the SIGNS dataset : Training set containing 1080 pictures (64 by 64 pixels) of signs representing numbers from 0 to 5 (180 pictures per number), and a test set with 120 pictures


- *TensorFlow Classification: MNIST digits with CNN and Regression* : 

Build and train a convolutional neural-network (CNN) and a Regression model for classifying MNIST digits dataset


- *Understanding CNNs -TensorFlow Digits dataset-*

In this project brings you with the fundamentals to understand how Convolutional Neural Networks work, first by presenting the building bloc functions to implement convolutional and pooling layers from scratch (just with numpy), and then by exposing a stadard and basic fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow


- *Recurrent Neural Networks - Basics*

In this project, we present a basic implementation of a RNN with LSTM. We used the MNIST dataset and we have achieved a 0.998 training accuracy and 0.992 testing accuracy.


- *Save and Restore a Model using TensorFlow*

The main purpose of this project is to bring you with a very clear understanding of how Tensorflow models are saved and restored.

- *TF_board*

This projet is an initiation to Tensorboard, which is a visualization software that comes with any standard TensorFlow installation in order to make it easier to understand, debug, and optimize TensorFlow programs.
