# Save and Restore a Model using TensorFlow

The main purpose of this project is to bring you with a very clear understanding of how Tensorflow models are saved and restored. Which will help your next models to resume where they left off and avoid long training times. Moreover, saving also gives you the possibility to share your model with other as well as to use people's last achievements to build your work on. 

This example is using the MNIST database of handwritten digits.
