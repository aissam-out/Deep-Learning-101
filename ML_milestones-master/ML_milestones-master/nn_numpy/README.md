# A step-by-step guide to build a deep neural network.

Here we present all the functions required to build a DeepNN. The 5-layer deepNN implementation is then used for an image classification
case study. This [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]-layer network is composed of ReLU as the activation function in all the layers except the output one 
(in which we use Sigmoid).
